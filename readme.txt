The Block Game (Based on The Fishy Game)

The Fishy Game: http://www.learn4good.com/kids-games/online/play_fishy_online.htm

This game has 3 levels, and you have a total of 3 lives to complete these levels. Each level gets progressively harder. The primary purpose of the game is to "eat" 7 blocks. You can only eat blocks that are smaller than you. Each time you eat a block, you increase in size. Going outside the boundaries that are given or attempting to eat a block that is greater or equal to you in size will result in a deduction of a life. The score is incremented +1 each time a block is consumed, and as previously mentioned, a score of 7 will advance the player to the next level, until level three is completed. Upon completion of level three, the game will be won.
